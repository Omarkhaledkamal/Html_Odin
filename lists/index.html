    <li>1 15-oz can chickpeas, rinsed, drained and warmed</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><em>Instructions</em></h2>
  <h3>Make the crispy onion topping.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sprinkle the onion rings with salt, then toss them in the flour to coat. Shake off excess flour.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat, cook the onion rings,<br> stirring often, until they turn a nice caramelized brown. Onions must be crispy, but not<br> burned (15-20 minutes).</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Make the Tomato Sauce.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon cooking oil. Add the grated onion, cook on medium-high<br> until the onion turns a translucent gold (do not brown). Now add the garlic,<br> coriander, and red pepper flakes, if using, and saute briefly until fragrant <br>(30-45 seconds more).</li>
    <li>Stir in tomato sauce and pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce<br> thickens (15 minutes or so).</li>
    <li>Stir in the distilled white vinegar, and turn the heat to low. Cover and keep warm until<br> ready to serve.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Make the Koshari</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot or saucepan over high heat.<br> 
      Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender (15-17 minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt.<br>
      (Note: when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked.<br>
      They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice).</li>
    <li>Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat<br>
      with 1 tablespoon cooking oil,salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly.<br>
      Add warm water to cover the rice and lentil mixture by about 1 &#189 inches (you'll probably use about 3 cups of water here).<br>
      Bring to a boil; the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 minutes).<br>
      Keep covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or so.</li>
    <li>Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions<br>
       by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain.</li>
    <li>Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Put it All Together!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To serve, fluff the rice and lentils with a fork and transfer to a serving platter.
      Top with the elbow pasta and &#189 of the tomato sauce, then the chickpeas, and finally &#189 of the crispy onions for garnish.
      Serve, passing the remaining sauce and crispy onions separately.</li>
  </ul>
